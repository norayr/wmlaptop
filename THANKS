First of all, many thanks to other coders from which
wmlaptop has taken some part of its own code

Thanks to Zinx Verituse for writing "fireload_cpu.c" in
his "wmfire" dockapp.

Thanks to Michele Noberasco for writing apm and acpi 
battery access in his "wmpower" dockapp. More exactly:
thanks to Costantino Pistagna for writing acpi part
in "wmacpimon", and to Filippo Panessa for apm part
in "wmab" (according to Noberasco's files)

At the end, thanks to my beautiful, first laptop,
(an ACER TravelMate 291LCi) which moves me to write this
dockapp; thanks to Paolo Attivissimo (www.attivissimo.net)
for some WindowsXp's License hits; and thanks to Linux
and all Open Source Community, to have opened my mind

----------

(specially) a patch. Hence..

Thanks to James Woodard to give me some suggestion

a strange behaviour of the dockapp
