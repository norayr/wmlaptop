INSTALLING:

before typing 'make' you could want to open the Makefile and edit
some installation and compilation option like INSTALLDIR or the C compiler

/*                 N O R M A L   I N S T A L L A T I O N               */
/* +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ */

$ make
$ su
# make install


/* +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ */
/* L O N G R U N   T R A N S M E T A   C P U   I N S T A L L A T I O N */
/* +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ */

$ make -f Makefile.Longrun
$ su
# make install


WARNING: the 'make install' script will suid the binary file (+s) to allow
normal user to change the cpu's frequence

READ CAREFULLY:
wmlaptop from 1.1 can shutdown the system. To do this, wmlaptop call this
command:
$(SHUTDOWN_BIN) +time $(SHUTDOWN_ARGS)
where 'time' is --shutdown-delay argument, and SHUTDOWN_BIN and SHUTDOWN_ARGS
are defined in src/autoscript.h
by default they are
#define SHUTDOWN_BIN      "sudo /sbin/shutdown"
#define SHUTDOWN_ARGS     "\"wmlaptop is shutting down the system\" -h"
As you can see, /sbin/shutdown cannot be executed by normal user, not even if
the binary is +s. Hence, if you are going to use wmlaptop as normal user (not
root) you need some workaround, like use 'sudo' (this is the default behaviour
of wmlaptop). To use "shutdown" with 'sudo' you have to append in /etc/sudoers
this line:

myusername ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown

where 'myusername' is your login name. If you do this, wmlaptop is free to
shutdown properly the system. Anyway, you can redefine SHUTDOWN_BIN and
SHUTDOWN_ARGS as you prefer (for example to change warning message or to use
another normal user shutdown script)

wmlaptop is now installed on your system!
